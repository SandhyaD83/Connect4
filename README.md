Connect Four is a game for two people. First you choose a colour. Then take it in turns to drop a disc into a grid that is usually seven columns by six rows. The aim is to get four of your coloured discs in a row, straight up, across, or diagonally.

## Game Rules

1. Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn. 
2. On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots. 
3. The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
4. The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game.
